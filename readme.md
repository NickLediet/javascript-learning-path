# Web Development Learning Path

Hi! I'm Nick and this is a series of course and links I used to teach myself web development as well as shared with peers I tutored while in college.

If your interested in learning something specific, unsure what resource to use or catch a spelling mistake, please open an issue on this repository and I will address it ASAP.

To stay update to date as I add additional resources I encourage you to follow (and star if you're feeling generous!) this repository.

## HTML & CSS
Coming Soon...

## Client Side JavaScript

These are all resources I used or have discovered, and wished I had when I learned JS. Some things to be aware of:
* Free Code Camp didn't exist when I learned JavaScript, however, I have done some of the advanced courses, and flipped through the intro courses and the are superb! I had instead learned via [Code School](https://www.pluralsight.com/codeschool) which has since been bought out by PluralSight.  I still cannot stress how much I feel the subscription is worth it if you're will to pay.
* Furthermore, I strongly recommend Code Academy as well. Unfortunately their free tier is nothing compared to what I remember is being.  Fortunately, their curriculum is even better and more relevant that when I went through it.

### Lessons:

1. [JavaScript Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fju9ii8YsGs): This is video by [Derek Banas](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCwRXb5dUK4cvsHbx-rGzSgw) is outstanding for introducing the syntax of JS.  Keep some, notes but honestly I didn't retain too much the first time I watched this, so keeping following a long helps a lot. Some of what covered isn't the most "up-to-date" however, it still serves as an outstand primer to getting started.
    * **Tips:** Try out things as taught, or maybe make flashcards if you're into that kinda thing.  Derek has made this (and all his other video) to be very efficient introductions.  The issue is he really doesn't go into to much depth about how it is used.  If you stick with it though, you'll be exposed to some essential concepts that will make actually learning the **Why & How** of JS much easier.
2. [Introduction to JavaScript](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/basic-javascript/): I love how free code camp teaches JavaScript by problem solving.  I don't think this gets into the DOM at all, however, you'll learn a lot about how to work with the actual language. Complete as much as you can since all of the lesson are super helpful.
3. [JavaScript Crash Course For Beginners (Updated)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdI2bqOjy3c): If you feel tht you're still a little unclear about JS foundations, give this video a watch.  Honestly if you can, watch as many of his videos as you can.  They are amaaaazing. I say I owe Brad Traversay my career, and I honestly feel like that is a true statement.  He has many video about not just programming but the industry and mental health.  **At the very least,** if you don't watch this video, poke around his YouTube channel and see if anything interests you.
4. [JavaScript DOM Crash Course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ik6X4DJKCc): Another Traveray Media video.  This is the meat and potatoes you want.  This is a short course on how to interact with the Browser and HTML (DOM) in JavaScript.  This is how you'll learn the cool stuff you want to do.
